## Indexed Case Studies
1. [Case 001: Why did I get a GitHub Spark access email if it’s still rolling out?](cases/case-001.md) — The Spark rollout is staged which means some parts of the system are live before the product is visible everywhere. The email you received was triggered early but your account has not yet been fully enabled. That is why the welcome link loads the holding page instead of the Spark workspace.  This happens when the marketing system and the feature flag system are not in sync. The email is correct in that you are on the access list but the backend is still rolling out activation. Once your account is flipped on you will be able to use Spark with the same link.  There is nothing you need to do on ...
1. [Case 002: what does secret scanning scan history return?](cases/case-002.md) — Secret scanning scan history returns the machine-readable identifier of the pattern, which is `pattern_slug`. That is what you will see in the API response.  The docs sometimes show `pattern_name` in examples for readability, but the actual response object includes the slug. You can map slugs back to human-friendly names using the patterns API if you need to display them.  If this solved your issue please mark the answer as helpful so others can find it....
1. [Case 003: Why copilot chat in Linux doesn't have option to change model?](cases/case-003.md) — The model selector is being rolled out gradually and is not yet available on all platforms. On Linux the chat panel currently defaults to the standard Copilot model and does not expose the dropdown. You can still control the experience by keeping your VS Code and the Copilot extension updated. The selector will appear once the rollout reaches your environment.  If this solved your issue please mark the answer as helpful so others can find it....
1. [Case 004: 非本人操作，我的仓库莫名其妙突然出现了test-action-1758516670662814635](cases/case-004.md) — 看起来是有人用你的账户凭据或授权的应用在你名下创建了仓库 默认的 GITHUB_TOKEN 只能在当前仓库内操作 创建新仓库通常需要你的登录状态 个人访问令牌 或安装的 GitHub App 的权限 所以最可能是令牌或应用被滥用 先做账号安全处置 开启双重验证或添加通行密钥 立刻更改密码并在所有设备退出登录 撤销所有活跃会话和已记住的设备 检查凭据与集成 在开发者设置里撤销并重新生成所有个人访问令牌 删除不认识的 SSH 和 GPG 密钥 查看已授权的 OAuth 应用和已安装的 GitHub Apps 移除任何不需要或来源不明的项 轮换组织和仓库里的所有 Secrets 查看证据与清理 打开安全日志和审计日志并按时间筛出 Create repository 和 Actions 相关事件 核对是哪个令牌或应用发起 在触发异常的仓库里检查最近的工作流定义和第三方 actions 把 Actions 策略改为只允许 GitHub 官方和受信任来源并且用提交哈希固定版本 移除可疑的自托管运行器 预防后续风险 为敏感操作启用额外保护规则 为默认分支开启受保护分支 最小化 GITHUB_TOKEN 和部署密钥的权限范围 如果需要进一步排查 把异常仓库名 发生时间 相关日志条目打包提交给 GitHub 支持 他们可以协助定位具体令牌或应用来源 如果这解决了你的问题请将此答案标记为有帮助 方便他...
1. [Case 005: manual workflow in features brach](cases/case-005.md) — Your workflow is in a feature branch. The Actions tab only lists workflows from the default branch. Until the file exists on the default branch it will not show up for manual runs.  Add a manual trigger to the workflow and merge it to the default branch under .github/workflows with a .yml or .yaml extension. Then use Run workflow to choose your feature branch as the ref.  Here is a minimal example you can commit to the default branch.  ```yaml name: Manual check  on:   workflow_dispatch:  jobs:   echo:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     steps:       - name: Show ref         run: |           echo "...
1. [Case 006: Date and time format](cases/case-006.md) — Right now GitHub always shows times in 12-hour AM/PM format in the UI and there isn’t a setting to switch it to 24-hour format even when you hover over timestamps The only customization available is changing your time zone in profile settings but not the display format So the answer is no you can’t change it today If you want 24-hour format the way to move it forward is to post a feature request through GitHub Feedback at https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/general or by opening a ticket with GitHub Support That way the product team can track demand for adding a 12/24-hour...
1. [Case 007: GitHub Copilot Usage Externally](cases/case-007.md) — GitHub Copilot is only offered as an IDE extension and through the GitHub.com interface. there is no official public API that you can legally call from your own apps or projects. using it externally by trying to reverse engineer or proxy its traffic would be against the terms of service if you want to integrate AI into your own project you need to use an API service that is explicitly licensed for that like OpenAI API or other model providers. Copilot itself cannot be embedded into external applications outside of the supported editors and environments if you find this solution helpfull upvote...
1. [Case 008: Github Action on PR merged and Environment question](cases/case-008.md) — Yes. You can run the deployment from the target branch or use pull_request_target so the job runs with the base branch context. Both approaches work and one is safer for accessing protected environments and secrets Option one use push on the target branch After a PR is merged GitHub creates a push to the target branch. Create a workflow that triggers on push to the target branch for example main and run your build and deploy there. Because the workflow runs on the target branch environment protection rules apply as expected and secrets are available only when the branch is allowed to use that ...
1. [Case 009: Agentes de IA com Python](cases/case-009.md) — Olá LeandroRespondendo direto e prático Sim é totalmente possível criar um agente em Python que use LangChain ou outras ferramentas e que converse pelo WhatsApp consultando um banco de dados para responder sobre estoque ou qualquer outra informação Fluxo simples de implementação Arquitetura básica Crie um webhook que receba mensagens do WhatsApp envie esse texto para seu backend onde o agente roda e retorne a resposta para o WhatsApp via API Integração com WhatsApp Use Twilio ou a WhatsApp Business API para receber e enviar mensagens. Elas entregam webhooks quando o usuário manda algo e aceita...
1. [Case 010: Can't set different model per mode](cases/case-010.md) — Right now Copilot does not let you assign different models to different custom modes. The model selection is global for your whole Copilot session so when you switch it for one mode it applies everywhere. Roo Code has that flexibility but Copilot does not support it yet. At the moment the only option is to manually change the model when you switch modes. If you find this solution helpful upvote this and please follow me it boosts my confidence...
1. [Case 011: if: ${{ github.event_name == 'workflow_call' }} not working in reuseable workflow](cases/case-011.md) — When a workflow runs as a reusable workflow the context is not the same as a normal event run so checking github.event_name == 'workflow_call' inside the called workflow does not work as you expect. The clean way is to pass the event type down as an input when you call the reusable workflow and then check that input inside. Example caller workflow jobs:   call-build:     uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable.yml     with:       caller_event: ${{ github.event_name }} Example reusable workflow on:   workflow_call:     inputs:       caller_event:         required: false  jobs:   build:     runs-on: ...
1. [Case 012: not receiving PR review requested notifications and cant find location to enable it](cases/case-012.md) — To get notified when someone requests your review you need to adjust two things First go to the repository page click Watch at the top right and choose Watching or Custom then make sure Pull requests is enabled Second go to your GitHub Settings → Notifications and under Participating and @mentions make sure email or web is checked so review requests are delivered to your inbox Also check the PR itself when you are added as reviewer open the PR and make sure you are subscribed on the right sidebar if it says Unsubscribed click Subscribe After that review requests should show up in your GitHub n...
1. [Case 013: Audit logs for certain actions show Unknown IP address](cases/case-013.md) — Yes  this is expected behavior, not a bug. Some audit log events (like pull_request_review_comment.create) are generated by server-side actions in GitHub’s infrastructure, not by a direct client request from a user device. Because of that, GitHub cannot attach a client IP, so the log shows Unknown IP address.  It’s not an error in your setup  other user-initiated events (push, sign-in, etc.) will continue to show correct IPs. For IP allowlists, these Unknown events won’t break access  allowlist enforcement applies at the time of the user’s API/web request, not to backend-generated events. You ...
