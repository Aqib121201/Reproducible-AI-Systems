## Problem
Brief restatement of the issue from the discussion.

## Solution I provided
GitHub Copilot is only offered as an IDE extension and through the GitHub.com interface. there is no official public API that you can legally call from your own apps or projects. using it externally by trying to reverse engineer or proxy its traffic would be against the terms of service
if you want to integrate AI into your own project you need to use an API service that is explicitly licensed for that like OpenAI API or other model providers. Copilot itself cannot be embedded into external applications outside of the supported editors and environments
if you find this solution helpfull upvote this and please follow me it boost my confidence
