## Problem
State the minimal reproducible problem in one paragraph.

## Solution I provided
GitHub Copilot is only offered as an IDE extension and through the GitHub.com interface. there is no official public API that you can legally call from your own apps or projects. using it externally by trying to reverse engineer or proxy its traffic would be against the terms of service if you want to integrate AI into your own project you need to use an API service that is explicitly licensed for that like OpenAI API or other model providers. Copilot itself cannot be embedded into external applications outside of the supported editors and environments if you find this solution helpfull upvote this and
