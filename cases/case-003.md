## Problem
State the minimal reproducible problem in one paragraph.

## Solution I provided
The model selector is being rolled out gradually and is not yet available on all platforms. On Linux the chat panel currently defaults to the standard Copilot model and does not expose the dropdown. You can still control the experience by keeping your VS Code and the Copilot extension updated. The selector will appear once the rollout reaches your environment. If this solved your issue please mark the answer as helpful so others can find it.

## Validation
Commands to run and expected output.

## Reproducibility Notes
OS and versions · Dependencies · Edge cases and rollback
