## Problem
Brief restatement of the issue from the discussion.

## Solution I provided
Yes  this is expected behavior, not a bug. Some audit log events (like pull_request_review_comment.create) are generated by server-side actions in GitHub’s infrastructure, not by a direct client request from a user device. Because of that, GitHub cannot attach a client IP, so the log shows Unknown IP address.

It’s not an error in your setup  other user-initiated events (push, sign-in, etc.) will continue to show correct IPs.
For IP allowlists, these Unknown events won’t break access  allowlist enforcement applies at the time of the user’s API/web request, not to backend-generated events.
You can safely enable IP allowlists; review comments will not be blocked just because the audit log doesn’t have an IP.
If you need 100% confirmation, the official docs mention that not all audit events carry IP metadata (especially those generated internally by GitHub systems).
