## Problem
State the minimal reproducible problem in one paragraph.

## Solution I provided
Right now Copilot does not let you assign different models to different custom modes. The model selection is global for your whole Copilot session so when you switch it for one mode it applies everywhere. Roo Code has that flexibility but Copilot does not support it yet. At the moment the only option is to manually change the model when you switch modes. If you find this solution helpful upvote this and please follow me it boosts my confidence

## Validation
