## Problem
Brief restatement of the issue from the discussion.

## Solution I provided
To get notified when someone requests your review you need to adjust two things
First go to the repository page click Watch at the top right and choose Watching or Custom then make sure Pull requests is enabled
Second go to your GitHub Settings â†’ Notifications and under Participating and @mentions make sure email or web is checked so review requests are delivered to your inbox
Also check the PR itself when you are added as reviewer open the PR and make sure you are subscribed on the right sidebar if it says Unsubscribed click Subscribe
After that review requests should show up in your GitHub notifications and if you enabled email they will also come to your mail GitHub Desktop will only mirror what shows in your account inbox
