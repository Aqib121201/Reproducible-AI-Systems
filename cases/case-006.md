## Problem
State the minimal reproducible problem in one paragraph.

## Solution I provided
Right now GitHub always shows times in 12-hour AM/PM format in the UI and there isn’t a setting to switch it to 24-hour format even when you hover over timestamps The only customization available is changing your time zone in profile settings but not the display format So the answer is no you can’t change it today If you want 24-hour format the way to move it forward is to post a feature request through GitHub Feedback at https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/general or by opening a ticket with GitHub Support That way the product team can track demand for adding a 12/24-hour preference toggle if you find this solution helpfull upvote this and
